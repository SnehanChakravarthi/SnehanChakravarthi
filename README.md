## _hi there_ ðŸ‘‹
 Iâ€™m _Snehan Chakravarthi_. A multi-disciplinary developer and designer with a passion for creating innovative web applications. My expertise spans a diverse range of projects, from AI platforms to interactive 3D front-ends.

 My mornings? A ritual. Brew some strong coffee and dive into VS Code. My coding sessions are nothing without Hanz Zimmer and Ludvig Goransson's epic scores, plus a sprinkle of serene, instrumental vibes. Afternoons are for geeking out â€“ gym sessions with my buddies, listening to Lex Fridman dinner with ThePrimeagen's video on the side, and slaying undead in Elden Ring to wrap up the day.

I'm all about chasing the new and the next â€“ Space Rockets E/Acc AI you name it. If it's got a tech edge, I'm there, ready to tinker and explore.
